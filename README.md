# Simon-Says
This is a classic puzzle game where, after pressing the "START" button, you are presented with an ever-growing sequence of flashing coloured lights. You must copy the sequence correctly to reach the next round. After rounds 5, 9 and 13 the game speeds up. Good luck!
The game is available to be played here:
