# Simon-Says
This is a classic puzzle game.
After pressing the "START" button, the game will begin after 5 seconds. You are presented with an ever-growing sequence of flashing coloured lights that you must copy correctly to reach the next round. After rounds 5, 9 and 13 the game speeds up. Good luck!
The game is available to be played here:
